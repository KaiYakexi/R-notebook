'Geometry Area (1996-97)'

OVERVIEW
Project:          Geometry Area 1996
PI:               Ken Koedinger
Curriculum:       Geometry
Dates:            Feb 1, 1996 - Feb 1, 1996
Area/Subject:     Math/Geometry
Tutor:            Cognitive Tutor 1996
Description:      This dataset has data from the area unit of the Geometry Cognitive Tutor
                  course as it was used during the school year 1996-1997.
                  Note 1: This dataset was created from a file resembling a student-step
                  rollup. Its transaction data was simulated based on step information.
                  Therefore, the timing information in the dataset is simulated as well, and
                  not based on genuine student interactions.

                  Note 2: The KC model Textbook_New_Compose has a labeling error in it (where
                  a rectangle problem is labeled with a circle KC) and this error was
                  carried over into some of the LFA models.
